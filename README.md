## Description
    
      - Given, no. of nodes in a tree and no of elements to be inserted, construct a binary search tree ( a tree in which all 
      its children in the left subtree is lesser than the root and all its children in the right 
      subtree is greater than the root) and convert the tree into its mirror image so that all 
      its left and right children of non-leaf nodes are interchanged.

## Input format
      - First line contains N which is the no. of nodes in a tree.
      - The next N lines contain the value of each node to be inserted in a bst.

## Constraints
       * 1 <= N,ele <= 10^5

## Output format
      - Print Inorder traversal of the given bst and mirror tree in such a way that each node should be in a separate line.

        - enter the no. of nodes:5
        - enter the element to be inserted:1
        - enter the element to be inserted:2
        - enter the element to be inserted:3
        - enter the element to be inserted:4

 ## Explanation0
       - constructed a bst using the function insert and displayed the inorder traversal of the given bst
       - converted bst into mirror tree and printed the inorder traversal.
