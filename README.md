## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
    
      - Given a no of elements to be inserted, construct a binary search tree ( a tree in which all 
      its children in the left subtree is lesser than the root and all its children in the right 
      subtree is greater than the root) and convert the tree into its mirror image so that all 
      its left and right children of non-leaf nodes are interchanged.
## Example:
   Binary Search tree
