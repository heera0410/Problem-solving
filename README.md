## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
    
      - Given a no of elements to be inserted, construct a binary search tree ( a tree in which all its children in the left subtree is lesser than the root and all its children in the right subtree is greater than the root) and convert the tree into its mirror image so that all its left and right children of non-leaf nodes are interchanged.
## Example:
       - Binary Search tree

       - Mirror image

## Sample Input And Output
        
        - Enter choice:1
        - Enter element to be inserted:1
        - Enter choice:1
        - Enter element to be inserted:2
        - Enter choice:1
        - Enter element to be inserted:3
        - Enter choice:1
        - Enter element to be inserted:4
        - Enter choice:1
        - Enter element to be inserted:5
        - Enter choice:2
        - Inorder traversal of the tree is 1 2 3 4 5
        - Enter choice:3
        - create Mirror image of the tree and call inorder traversal
        - Enter choice:2
        - Inorder traversal of the tree is 5 4 3 2 1
